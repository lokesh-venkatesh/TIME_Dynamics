This project is jointly between Prof. Ram Rup Sarkar at NCL Pune, and Dr. Chandrakala Meena of IISER Pune. For the time being, I am attempting to reproduce the results published in the following two publications:

1. Modeling immunotherapy of the tumor-immune interaction (Kirschner-Panetta)
2. Exploring immuno-regulatory mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment: Model and design of protocols for cancer remission (Ganguli-Sarkar)
